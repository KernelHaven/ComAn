/**
 * This class implements analysis methods and required attributes for counting the changes made to a build file (Make).<br><br>
 * 
 * In particular, this class differentiates between changed lines containing general build information and
 * lines that contain variability information, e.g. conditional build targets.<br><br>
 * 
 * A changed line is counted as variability change if that particular line contains a reference to a
 * Kconfig-symbol, e.g. "$CONFIG_X". Concatenations will not be counted as variability change, for example:<br><br>
 * 
 * dtb-$(CONFIG_MACH_KIRKWOOD) += \ <br>
 *   kirkwood-b3.dtb \ <br>
 * +  kirkwood-blackarmor-nas220.dtb<br><br>
 * 
 * The last line is a general change to a build file but is not counted as variability change.<br><br>
 * 
 * Further elements of conditional statements like:<br><br>
 * 
 * ifeq ($(CONFIG_PAYLOAD_ELF),y) <br>
 *    ... <br>
 * -else <br>
 *     ... <br>
 * -endif <br><br>
 * 
 * are counted as variability change (here "else" and "endif") as they belong to a condition that
 * references a Kconfig-symbol.
