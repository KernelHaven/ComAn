 # BusyBox configuration option Help File
 #
 # Format of this file: description<nl>variable<nl>help text<nl><nl>.
 # The help texts may contain empty lines, but every non-empty line must
 # be indented two positions.  Order of the help texts does not matter,
 # however, no variable should be documented twice: if it is, only the
 # first occurrence will be used. We try to keep the help texts of related
 # variables close together. Lines starting with `#' are ignored. To be
 # nice to menuconfig, limit your line length to 70 characters. 
 #
 # Comments of the form "# Choice:" followed by a menu name are used
 # internally by the maintainers' consistency-checking tools.
 #
 # If you add a help text to this file, please try to be as gentle as
 # possible. Don't use unexplained acronyms and generally write for the
 # hypothetical ignorant but intelligent user who has just bought a PC,
 # removed Windows, installed Linux and is now compiling up BusyBox
 # for the first time. Tell them what to do if they're unsure. 
 #
 # Mention all the relevant READMEs and HOWTOs in the help text.
 # Make them file URLs relative to the top level of the source tree so
 # that help browsers can turn them into hotlinks.  All URLs ahould be
 # surrounded by <>.
 #
 # Repetitions are fine since the help texts are not meant to be read
 # in sequence.  It is good style to include URLs pointing to more
 # detailed technical information, pictures of the hardware, etc.
 #
 # The most important thing to include in a help entry is *motivation*.
 # Explain why someone configuring BusyBox might want to select your
 # option.
 #
 
+Show verbose applets usage message
+CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
+  All BusyBox applets will show more verbose help messages when
+  busybox is invoked with --help.  This will add lots of text to the
+  busybox binary.  In the default configuration, this will add about
+  13k, but it can add much more depending on your configuration.
+
+Enable automatic symlink creation for BusyBox built-in applets
+CONFIG_FEATURE_INSTALLER
+  Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support.  This will allow you to use
+  busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
+  applets that are compiled into busybox.  This feature requires the
+  /proc filesystem.
+
+Locale support
+CONFIG_LOCALE_SUPPORT
+  Enable this if your system has locale support, and you would like
+  busybox to support locale settings.
+
+Enable devfs support
+CONFIG_FEATURE_DEVFS
+  Enable if you want BusyBox to work with devfs.
+
+Clean up all memory before exiting
+CONFIG_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
+  As a size optimization, busybox by default does not cleanup memory
+  that is dynamically allocated or close files before exiting. This
+  saves space and is usually not needed since the OS will clean up for
+  us.  Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
+  things up manually.
+
+Buffers allocation policy
+CONFIG_FEATURE_BUFFERS_USE_MALLOC
+  There are 3 ways BusyBox can handle buffer allocations:
+  - Use malloc. This costs code size for the call to xmalloc.
+  - Put them on stack. For some very small machines with limited stack
+    space, this can be deadly.  For most folks, this works just fine.
+  - Put them in BSS. This works beautifully for computers with a real
+    MMU (and OS support), but wastes runtime RAM for uCLinux. This
+    behavior was the only one available for BusyBox versions 0.48 and
+    earlier.
+
 Enable the ar applet
 CONFIG_AR
-  ar is an archival utility program used to creates, modify, and
+  ar is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
   extract contents from archives.  An archive is a single file holding
   a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to
-  retrieve the original individual files (called archive members).  The
-  original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and
-  group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
-  extraction.  On an x86 system, the ar applet adds about XXX bytes.

+  and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
+  extraction.  
+  On an x86 system, the ar applet adds about XXX bytes.
 
   Unless you have a specific application which requires ar, you should
   probably say N here.
 
 Enable the bunzip2 applet
 CONFIG_BUNZIP2
   bunzip2 is an compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block
   sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression
   is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
   conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the
   performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.  
   
   The BusyBox bunzip2 applet is limited to de-compression only.  On an
   x86 system, this applet adds about XXX bytes.
   
   Unless you have a specific application which requires bunzip2, you
   should probably say N here.
 
 # FIXME -- document the rest of the BusyBox config options....
 
 Enable the run-parts applet
 CONFIG_RUN_PARTS
   run-parts is an utility designed to run all the scripts in a directory.
 
-  It is useful to set up directory like cron.daily, where we have to
-  execute all the script contained.
+  It is useful to set up a directory like cron.daily, where you need to
+  execute all the scripts in that directory.
 
   This implementation of run-parts doesn't accept long options, and
   some features (like report mode) aren't implemented.
 
   Unless you know that run-parts is used in some of your scripts
   you can safely say N here.
