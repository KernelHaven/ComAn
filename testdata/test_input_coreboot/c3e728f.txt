commit c3e728fbdfa6a92a9b07e46d0ae0da7259e29d35
Author: Jordan Crouse <jordan.crouse@amd.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 9 23:05:59 2008 +0000

    libpayload: Implement gcc wrappers for libpayload
    
    libpayload uses a ton of flags and other scary gcc and ld options.  These
    wrappers hide most of that from the user, so that using libpayload is as
    easy as lpgcc -o hello hello.c
