    Pull MIPS build fix from Ralf Baechle:
     "Fix a makefile issue resulting in build breakage with older binutils.
    
      This has sat in -next for a few days, testers and buildbot are happy
      with it, too though if you are going for another -rc that'd certainly
      help ironing out a few more issues"
    
    * 'upstream' of git://git.linux-mips.org/pub/scm/ralf/upstream-linus:
      MIPS: VDSO: Fix build error with binutils 2.24 and earlier
