    Merge branch 'strscpy' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cmetcalf/linux-tile
    
    Pull strscpy fixes from Chris Metcalf :
     "This patch series fixes up a couple of architecture issues where
      strscpy wasn't configured correctly (missing on h8300, duplicating
      local and asm-generic copies on powerpc and tile).
    
      It also adds a use of zero_bytemask() to the final store for strscpy
      to avoid writing uninitialized data to the destination.  However, to
      make this work we had to add support for zero_bytemask() to the two
      architectures that didn't have it (alpha and tile), because they were
      providing their own local copies, but didn't provide the
      zero_bytemask() that was previously only required when building with
      CONFIG_DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS"
    
    [ Side note: there is still no actual users of strscpy except for the
      one preexisting use in arch/tile that predates the generic version.
      So this is all about fixing the infrastructure so that we eventually
      can start using it.  - Linus ]

      strscpy: zero any trailing garbage bytes in the destination
      word-at-a-time.h: support zero_bytemask() on alpha and tile
